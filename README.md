Chotu-php-Framework (Small Yet Powerfull)
===================

A super easy php framework using Super simple procedural approach to MVC architecture.

This framwork is excellent for small to Mid size applications, though you can use this for bigger projects with extreemly small modifications on how different blocks work together.

What this does not use:
=====================
- Object oriented programing standards for function/method abstraction.
- SEF (This framework WILL use SEF approach to the urls )


What This Framework Is ?
=====================
A framework with a very small footprint, to help new developers work with MVC architecture and still enabling them to create powerfull features on there own.



TO DO:
=====
- .htacess SEF Urls.
- Few helper functions to work on strings.
- Php Library to work with Facebook authentication.
- Universal module to support major payment gateways.
- Module installation


How to Update ?
================
Simply replace Lib Folder, BUT before doing that you need to make a copy of the config.php inside it so that you can replace it over the upgraded version.
